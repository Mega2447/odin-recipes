        Feeds 3-4.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Small Yellow Onion, minced</li>
            <li>8-10oz Baby Bella Mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup Arborio Rice</li>
            <li>4 cups Unsalted Beef Broth, warmed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese, grated</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>5 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3/4 tbsp Dried Thyme</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>If broth is not already warmed, warm in separate dish on the stove.</li>
            <li>In a wide pan on low-medium heat, melt butter. Once melted, add onion, garlic, mushrooms, thyme. Add a dash of salt no more than 1/2 tsp. Sweat and cook down until onions are translucent.</li>
            <li>Once sweated out, add rice and toast until grains begin to become translucent, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1 to 1 1/2 cups broth to the pan. Typically this should be enough broth to just cover the rice. Stir rice slightly and shake pan to loosen grains on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Once rice absorbs enough broth to fall below rice line, add another round of broth. At this point taste the broth and begin salting gradually between rounds, to taste.</li>
            <li>As the last bit of broth is cooking down, taste the rice. Once rice is al dente and creamy, remove from heat and stir in parmesan cheese. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
